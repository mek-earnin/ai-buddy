# AIBuddy

A system-tray app that rewrites your text in different tones using AI. Works in **Slack desktop**, Slack web, and any application with a text field.

## How It Works

1. Select text in any app (Slack, email, browser, etc.)
2. Press `Option+Space` (Mac) or `Alt+Space` (Windows/Linux)
3. A single command palette appears with your selection captured at the top
4. Type to fuzzy-search any action (e.g. "friendly", "summarize", "standup"), then press `↵` — or use the inline `⌘1…9` shortcuts
5. The result streams in live; press `↵` to Apply & Paste, `⌘C` to copy, or `⌘R` to regenerate

Everything happens on one keyboard-first surface — no menu drilling. Turn on **Auto-paste** in Settings to skip the review step entirely.

## Actions

Actions are organized into three groups. In the palette, the first few are reachable via `⌘1…9` quick-select.

### Rephrase

Rewrites your selected text while preserving its meaning and original language.

- **Professional** — polished, business-appropriate wording; drops slang and casual phrasing.
- **Friendly** — warm, conversational, and approachable tone.
- **Direct** — concise and to the point; strips hedging and filler.

### Generate

Creates new text for you.

- **Ask** — ask anything in plain English and get a direct answer; any selected text is used as context.
- **Activity Notes** — drafts a standup update or shift/call handoff from your recent JIRA and GitHub activity.

### Tools

Transform or analyze the text you selected.

- **Summarize** — condenses the selection into a short TL;DR.
- **Review Polish** — rewrites code-review feedback to be constructive and actionable.
- **Prompt Refiner** — fills in missing pieces and optimizes a prompt for an AI agent.
- **Explain Error** — finds the likely root cause and fix for an error or stack trace.

## Install (for users)

Grab the latest installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/kamolhasan/ai-buddy/releases):

- **macOS** — download the `.dmg`, open it, and drag AIBuddy to Applications.
- **Windows** — download the `.exe` (Setup) and run it.

The app isn't signed with a paid certificate yet, so your OS will warn you the first time:

- **macOS** — right-click the app and choose **Open**, then confirm. (If it reports the app is "damaged", run `xattr -cr /Applications/AIBuddy.app` once, then open it.) You'll also need to grant Accessibility permission — see [macOS Permissions](#macos-permissions).
- **Windows** — on the SmartScreen prompt, click **More info** then **Run anyway**.

After installing, open AIBuddy from the tray and add your AI provider API key in Settings (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

## Setup (from source)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- An API key from OpenAI or Anthropic

### Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Configuration

On first launch, click the tray icon → Settings to configure:
- AI Provider (OpenAI or Anthropic)
- API Key
- Model selection
- Custom keyboard shortcut

### macOS Permissions

AIBuddy needs **two** macOS permissions to read your selection and paste results:

1. **Accessibility** — System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → enable "AIBuddy".
2. **Automation** — System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation → AIBuddy → enable "System Events".

Granting Accessibility alone is not enough; without Automation, macOS silently blocks the copy/paste and the palette will open with no selected text. After changing either permission, fully quit and reopen AIBuddy. You can re-open these panes anytime from the tray icon → **Permissions Help**.

## Development

```bash
# Watch mode (rebuilds on changes)
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run Electron
npx electron dist/main.js

# Build distributable
npm run dist
```

## Releasing

Installers are built and published automatically by GitHub Actions ([.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)) whenever a version tag is pushed:

```bash
# 1. Bump the "version" in package.json, then commit it
git commit -am "Release v1.0.0"

# 2. Tag and push — this triggers the macOS + Windows build
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin main --tags
```

The workflow builds on `macos-latest` and `windows-latest` and uploads the `.dmg`, `.zip`, and Windows `.exe` to a GitHub Release. No secrets to configure — it uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Tech Stack

- Electron (TypeScript)
- React (renderer UI)
- OpenAI SDK / Anthropic SDK
- Webpack (bundler)

## Troubleshooting

- **macOS: "Apple could not verify…" or app won't open** — the app isn't notarized (see note below). Open System Settings → Privacy & Security, click **Open Anyway** next to the AIBuddy message (or right-click the app → **Open**).
- **macOS: "AIBuddy is damaged and can't be opened"** — clear the quarantine flag once: `xattr -cr /Applications/AIBuddy.app`, then open it.
- **Windows: "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen)** — click **More info** then **Run anyway**.
- **No window appears on launch** — that's expected. AIBuddy lives in the menu bar / system tray; click its icon, or press `Option+Space` (`Alt+Space` on Windows/Linux).
- **macOS: `Option+Space` opens the palette but no text is captured** — you're missing the **Automation** permission. Enable AIBuddy under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation → System Events (and Accessibility), then restart AIBuddy. The tray → **Permissions Help** menu opens these panes for you.
- **macOS: pressing the shortcut still does nothing** — first confirm the app is running (menu-bar icon). Try the tray → **Show AIBuddy** menu item: if that also does nothing, check tray → **Open Logs** for the cause. If only the shortcut fails, it's likely a conflict — pick a different one in Settings.
- **"Failed to register shortcut"** — another app is using `Option/Alt+Space`. Pick a different shortcut in Settings.
- **Actions error out or return nothing** — make sure you've set a valid API key and model in Settings. Standup/Handoff also need your JIRA and GitHub credentials.
- **Linux: API keys not saved securely** — without a system keyring, keys are stored unencrypted. Install a keyring (e.g. GNOME Keyring) for encrypted storage.

> **Note on the "unverified developer" / malware warning:** AIBuddy is currently distributed without Apple notarization (no paid Apple Developer ID), so macOS shows this warning and permissions can be less reliable for unsigned apps. The permanent fix is to sign with a Developer ID Application certificate and notarize the build — planned for when an Apple Developer account is available.
